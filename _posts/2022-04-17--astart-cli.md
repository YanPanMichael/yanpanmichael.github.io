This is a beautiful tool to help you to post release process with one command. I strongly encourage you to [take 1 minutes to learn how to use qk-release](https://github.com/YanPanMichael/qk-release) - it'll teach you how to install and config into your app.

## Feature

- One common and quick tool for quick release
- interacion UI with CLI
- Combine with version update, tag commit, building(optional), change log(optional), pushing to git, publishing(optional) etc.

<!-- How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

## install

**Here's a code chunk:**

First, install qk-release in your node_modules folder:

~~~
npm i -D qk-release # OR yarn add -D qk-release
~~~

And here is the same config with release script highlighting:

```javascript
  "scripts": {
    "release": "qkrelease <--skipBuild | --skipLog | --skipPublish>"
  },
```

Finally, start the build and package process:

~~~
npm run release # OR yarn release
~~~

<!-- And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %} -->
