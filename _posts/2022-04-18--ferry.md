This is a beautiful framework to help you to post a http request with a related ecological system. I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to use ferry](https://github.com/YanPanMichael/ferry) - it'll teach you how to install and config into your app.

## Feature

- One common and strong http fetch tool with ecosystem features

<!-- Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |

| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One | -->


<!-- How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

## install

**Here's the code chunk:**

First, install @ferry-core/ferry in your node_modules folder:

~~~
npm i -D @ferry-core/ferry # OR yarn add -D @ferry-core/ferry
~~~

And here is the import method with release highlighting:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
import { fetch } from "@ferry-core/ferry"
fetch().then()
{% endhighlight %} -->

<!-- And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %} -->
