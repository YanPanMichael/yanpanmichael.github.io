This is a beautiful framework to help you to post a http request with a related ecological system. I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to use ferry](https://github.com/YanPanMichael/ferry) - it'll teach you how to install and config into your app.

## Feature

- One common and strong http fetch tool with ecosystem features

## install

**Here's the code chunk:**

First, install @ferry-core/ferry in your node_modules folder:

~~~
npm i -D @ferry-core/ferry # OR yarn add -D @ferry-core/ferry
~~~

And here is the import method with release highlighting:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
import { fetch } from "@ferry-core/ferry"
fetch().then()
{% endhighlight %}
